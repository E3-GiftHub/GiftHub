Peer-to-Peer Gifting Platform 
Create a peer-to-peer/crowdsourcing gifting platform that simplifies the gifting process for various events such as weddings, birthdays, and other celebrations. The platform will allow event organizers or celebrants to create wishlists for gifts they desire. Guests can then contribute towards these gifts by pooling money together or choosing to leave cash gifts through the application. The platform will facilitate the purchase of gifts directly from the wishlist, which can include items from popular online retailers like Amazon, eMag, Altex, etc. To ensure a seamless gifting experience, the platform will display which items have been purchased to prevent duplicate gifts and will offer an option for guests to contribute cash towards items on the list or as a direct cash gift using their credit card.

Features:
Wishlist Creation: Event organizers can easily create and manage wishlists, adding items from a catalog of products sourced from various online retailers.
Gift Pooling: Guests can pool money together to fund more expensive gifts on the wishlist, making it easier to contribute towards something special.
Cash Gifts: An option for guests to leave cash gifts through a secure payment gateway, providing flexibility in how they wish to contribute.
Party photo/video gallery: Guests can upload images taken at the event to share with the other participants.
Duplicate Prevention: The platform will track purchased items in real-time, updating the wishlist to prevent duplicate gifts.
Payment Integration: Utilize Stripe Connect to manage transactions, ensuring a secure and efficient payment process for both collecting contributions and disbursing funds to the celebrant or for the purchase of gifts.
Monetization (PoC level): Leverage affiliate programs such as ProfitShare and Amazonâ€™s Affiliate Program to earn commissions on purchases made through the platform. Additionally, a commission model can be implemented on transactions processed through Stripe Connect to generate revenue.

Technical Components:
Affiliate Integration: Integrate with affiliate programs to pull product information and links, allowing users to add items to their wishlists directly from supported online stores.
Payment Processing: Implement Stripe Connect for handling payments, including charging guests and disbursing funds to the event organizer or directly to vendors for gift purchases.
Product Information Schema: Use Schema.org standards to pull and display product information, ensuring consistency and accuracy in product listings.

Challenges and Considerations:
Security and Privacy: Ensure that all financial transactions are secure and that users' personal and payment information is protected.
User Experience: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of creating wishlists, contributing to gifts, and managing contributions.
Payment Disbursement: Develop a reliable system for disbursing funds, whether for purchasing gifts directly from vendors or transferring cash gifts to the celebrant.
Legal and Financial Compliance: Navigate legal and financial regulations related to online transactions, crowdfunding, and handling of personal data.

Goal:
This platform aims to revolutionize the way we think about gifting for special occasions by making it more collaborative, efficient, and meaningful. By simplifying the process of pooling resources for gifts, it encourages more thoughtful and significant contributions, enhancing the overall experience for both the gift-givers and recipients.
